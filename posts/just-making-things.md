**“just setting up this site.”** 

… and migrating what I already built in the past. so now it’s somewhat of a personal page with a `posts` /page.

if you’re reading this: hi! this is free flow writing, it’s also pretty late/early, so excuse any typos.

i don’t intend for this to become a regular blog or publication, much rather it’s a playground. i like tinkering with technologies, and this helps me become a lot better at it. 

**why i’ve set this up:**<br> 
i love browsing the web and finding people’s writing. there’s so many hidden gems in the `posts` or `blog` or `projects` sections of so many websites, it’s incredible. 

that’s how most people start out, i believe: they just make things they find interesting. and put them on the web somewhere. some then write about it. reading accompanying thoughts allows you to dive deeper. understand motivations, beliefs, plans, struggles. it adds nuance, it adds depth. i love that. because no one starts out as a finished product, and seeing how different projects compound makes people’s journeys a lot more tangible.

over time, i’ll write about things i find interesting, have learned, want to talk about, or have built. there likely won’t be a common theme, and that’s the point — it’s supposed to become a collection of thoughts, somewhat curated.

the problem with setting up a newsletter or similar is that n years from now, no one will remember the platform you did it on. setting up a simple website — as long as you don’t let the domain expire – will live on. actually, i don’t know if that’s true, but i choose to believe so.

for as long as i can remember, i’ve loved writing. it helps me think. seeing my thoughts manifest on a screen is just special. it often reveals things i don’t consciously think of. journaling / writing / “typing on the computer” is probably the single most valuable and compounding habit i’ve ever started. i can go back to many moments in life and re-visit what i wrote down, re-living it.

putting my writing out for the world to see was something i was never particularly comfortable with. i guess overcoming that in addition to simply wanting to “make more things” is also what made me build this on a saturday/sunday night.

why make things? many reasons: firstly, you simply won’t improve if you don’t put in reps. if i look at designs / code / writing from the past and compare it to what i create now, i’m usually embarrassed — good! that’s how it’s supposed to be. secondly, it’s just fun. i also believe code/media aren’t going anywhere in the future, so being able to leverage that should help. :) 

ending this with a quote from creativity, inc. (after ~3 years of wanting to i’ve finally gotten around to reading it)

__"Creativity has to start somewhere, and we are true believers in the power of bracing, candid feedback and the iterative process – reworking, reworking, and reworking again, until a flawed story finds it throughline or a hollow character finds its soul.”__

see you next time 👋
