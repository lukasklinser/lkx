### lkx.so
after wanting to do it for a long time, i'm finally doing it: building a website with next.js

tl;dr:
* this is my personal website
* it includes a `posts` section — so effectively... it's a blog... i guess.
* i'll use this to build on for future pages on the future

roadmap:
* about 
* work / projects / interests
