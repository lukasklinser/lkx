### lkx.so
first time playing with next.js + extending it

tl;dr:
* my own little corner of the internet
* it includes a `posts` section â€” so effectively... it's a blog... i guess.
* i'll use this to build on for future pages on the future

"roadmap":
* ~~figure out nasty tailwind darkmode bug~~
* hotkeys + navigation
* more writing (i.e. publish private notes)
* play with more technologies i haven't played with yet :)
